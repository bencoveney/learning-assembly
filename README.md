# Compiler

Goals:

- Learn lower level concepts.

Non-goal:

- Language design.

Plan:

- Implement compiler.
- Implement assembler.
- Implement linker.
- Extent simple language with some larger concepts.
- Rewrite compiler pipeline in language.

Compiler implementation:

- Perhaps use Rust, Zig or C? Opportunity to get to grips with them.
- Perhaps WASM as a compile target?

Language:

- Just enough to get work done.
- Use the source code of the implemented compiler to determine what features the language needs.
