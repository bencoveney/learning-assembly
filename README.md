# Compiler

Goals:

- Learn lower level concepts.

Non-goal:

- Language design.

Plan:

- Implement compiler in C (language to assembly).
- Extent simple language with some larger concepts.
- Rewrite compiler pipeline in language.
- Implement assembler (assembly to machine code, probably x86).
- Implement linker (x86 to ELF).

Language:

- Just enough to get work done.
- Use the source code of the implemented compiler to determine what features the language needs.
